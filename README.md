# My take on Conway's Game of Life
This is my own attempt at recreating the famous 0-player Game of Life. I'm using matplotlib to create images from a matrix, which are then used to create a gif.
It is, as of right now, not optimized at all for long gifs. Anything above ~50 frames takes a painfully long time.

You can create presets using my other script [Preset creator](https://github.com/flexflower/Preset-Creator)
